I'm a dumbass so i am storing here the method to commit to git

1. Download thingy
git clone https://github.com/YukiZensho/StartThingy
	or
git pull

2. Commit thingy to branch
	to see what's been changed
git status
	may be needed
git add .
	to name the commit*
git commit -a -m "NAME OF COMMIT"
	push
git push origin master
